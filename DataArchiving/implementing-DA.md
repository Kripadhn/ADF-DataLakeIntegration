Create an Azure Data Factory instance: You can create an ADF instance using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or the Azure Resource Manager template.

Create a Data Lake Storage account: You can create a Data Lake Storage account using the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

Create a Data Factory pipeline: You can create a pipeline in ADF to move data from a source to a destination. In this case, the source could be a database, and the destination could be Data Lake Storage.

Copy data to Data Lake Storage: In the pipeline, you can use the Copy Activity to move data from the source to the destination. You can specify the source and destination connection details, the mapping of columns, and the data format.

Load the data into Data Lake Storage: In the pipeline, you can use a Python script to load the data into Data Lake Storage. You can use the PySpark or the Azure Python SDK to load the data.

Schedule the pipeline: Finally, you can schedule the pipeline to run automatically at specific intervals. You can schedule the pipeline using the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.
