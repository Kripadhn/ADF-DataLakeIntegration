implementation steps of Data Migration using ADF and loading into Data Lake Storage
Prerequisites:

An Azure subscription
An Azure Data Factory
A Data Lake Storage account
A Source database
Create a Linked Service to connect to the source database:

In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Data Factory
Click on the 'Author & Monitor' button to open the Azure Data Factory Editor
In the Azure Data Factory Editor, click on the 'Author & Deploy' tab
In the 'Author & Deploy' tab, click on 'New Linked Service'
In the 'New Linked Service' screen, select the database type as the source
Fill in the connection details for the source database, including the database server name, username, and password
Click on the 'Create' button to create the linked service
Create a Linked Service to connect to the Data Lake Storage account:

In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Data Factory
Click on the 'Author & Monitor' button to open the Azure Data Factory Editor
In the Azure Data Factory Editor, click on the 'Author & Deploy' tab
In the 'Author & Deploy' tab, click on 'New Linked Service'
In the 'New Linked Service' screen, select 'Data Lake Store' as the type
Fill in the connection details for the Data Lake Storage account, including the Data Lake Storage account name and access key
Click on the 'Create' button to create the linked service
Create the source and destination datasets:

In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Data Factory
Click on the 'Author & Monitor' button to open the Azure Data Factory Editor
In the Azure Data Factory Editor, click on the 'Author & Deploy' tab
In the 'Author & Deploy' tab, click on 'New Dataset'
In the 'New Dataset' screen, select the source database type as the type
Fill in the dataset details, including the linked service and the database table name
Click on the 'Create' button to create the source dataset
Repeat the above steps to create the destination dataset, but select 'Data Lake Store' as the type
Fill in the dataset details, including the linked service and the Data Lake Storage path
Create a pipeline to migrate the data:

In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Data Factory
Click on the 'Author & Monitor' button to open the Azure Data Factory Editor
In the Azure Data Factory Editor, click on the 'Author & Deploy' tab
In the 'Author & Deploy' tab, click on 'New Pipeline'
In the 'New Pipeline' screen, drag and drop the 'Copy Data' activity from the activity bar
Fill in the source and destination datasets for the 'Copy Data' activity
Click on the 'Publish All' button to publish the changes
Execute the pipeline:

In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Data Factory
Click on the 'Author & Monitor' button to open the Azure Data Factory Editor
In the Azure Data Factory Editor, click on the 'Author & Monitor' tab
In the 'Author & Monitor' tab, click on the 'Start' button

Step 1: Create a data factory
Step 2: Create linked services
Step 3: Create datasets
Step 4: Define the pipeline
Step 5: Create a pipeline to migrate the data:
Step 6: Execute the pipeline:

--------------

5. Create a pipeline to migrate the data:
This code uses the Azure Data Factory management client to create a pipeline that migrates data from a SQL Server database to Data Lake Storage. The source and destination datasets are defined as instances of the AzureDataLakeStoreDataset class, while the copy activity is defined as an instance of the CopyActivity class. The pipeline is defined as an instance of the PipelineResource class. The pipeline is created using the create_or_update method of the pipelines attribute of the Data Factory management client.

Before running this code, you'll need to replace the placeholders with your own values for the client_id, client_secret, tenant_id, subscription_id, data_factory_name, and the names of your linked services for the SQL Server database and Data Lake Storage account.

6. Execute the pipeline:

This code uses the Azure Data Factory management client to start the pipeline run and wait for it to complete. The create_run method of the pipelines attribute of the Data Factory management client is used to start the pipeline run. The wait_for_completion method of the pipeline_runs attribute of the Data Factory management client is used to wait for the pipeline run to complete. The status of the pipeline run is checked to determine if it completed successfully or failed.

Before running this code, you'll need to replace the placeholders with your own values for the client_id, client_secret, tenant_id, subscription_id, data_factory_name, and the name of your pipeline.
