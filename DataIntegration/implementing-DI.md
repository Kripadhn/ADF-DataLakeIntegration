Here are the steps to implement data integration using Azure Data Factory and load the data into Data Lake Storage with code:

Create a Data Lake Storage account: Before you can load data into Data Lake Storage, you need to have a Data Lake Storage account. If you don't already have one, you can create one in the Azure portal.

Create a linked service: A linked service defines the connection information to a data source or sink. To create a linked service in Azure Data Factory, you'll need to use the Azure Data Factory management client to create a linked service definition.

Before running this code, you'll need to replace the placeholders with your own values for the client_id, client_secret, tenant_id, subscription_id, data_factory_name, datalake_storage_account_name, and the name of your linked service.

Create a dataset: A dataset defines the structure and format of data in a data source. To create a dataset in Azure Data Factory, you'll need to use the Azure Data Factory management client to create a dataset definition.

Before running this code, you'll need to replace the placeholders with your own values for the client_id, client_secret, tenant_id, subscription_id, data_factory_name, and the name of your linked service. Also, you'll need to specify the path to your file in Data Lake Storage in the datalake_file_path property.

Create a copy activity:
The copy activity is the core component of the pipeline. It specifies the source and destination of the data and how to transfer it.

Before running this code, you'll need to replace the placeholders with your own values for the source_type, source_details, destination_type, destination_details, and copy_activity_name.

Create a pipeline definition with the copy activity:
A pipeline is a collection of activities, such as the copy activity, that are executed in a specific order.

Create the pipeline:
The pipeline definition needs to be created in the Azure Data Factory using the Azure Data Factory management client.

from azure.mgmt.datafactory import DataFactoryManagementClient
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

Before running this code, you'll need to replace the placeholders with your own values for the client_id, client_secret, tenant_id, subscription_id, data_factory_name, and the name of your pipeline.

Execute the pipeline:
Once the pipeline is created, you can execute it by using the Azure Data Factory management client to trigger the pipeline.
